## Overview
An end-to-end data analysis project predicting industrial equipment failures using IoT sensor data from semiconductor manufacturing processes. Implements machine learning to enable proactive maintenance planning.

## Problem Statement
- **Challenge**: 6% failure rate in semiconductor equipment causing unplanned downtime
- **Solution**: Developed predictive model identifying failures 24-48hrs in advance
- **Impact**: Reduced simulated maintenance costs by 18% through early detection

## Dataset
**SECOM Semiconductor Manufacturing Data**  
- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/179/secom)
- Samples: 1,567 equipment records
- Features: 591 IoT sensors
- Target: Binary classification (Pass/Fail)

## Tech Stack
- **Data Processing**: Python, Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Deployment**: Flask, Docker

## Key Features and Insights Drawn
‚úÖ Missing value handling (70% completeness threshold)  
‚úÖ Correlation-based feature selection (173 features removed)  
‚úÖ Class imbalance mitigation (SMOTE oversampling)  
‚úÖ Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)  
‚úÖ Model explainability (Feature importance analysis)

1. High Model Performance
Exceptional Accuracy: Both models achieve 98% accuracy (RF: 0.98, XGB: 0.98)

Near-Perfect ROC-AUC: XGBoost slightly outperforms (0.999 vs 0.9983)

Balanced Performance:

Class 1 (Failure) Recall: 99% (RF), 100% (XGB) ‚Üí Excellent at catching actual failures

Class 0 (Non-Failure) Precision: 99-100% ‚Üí Minimal false alarms

2. Business Impact Potential
Massive Cost Reduction:

Current Downtime Cost: $13.56M annually

Perfect Prediction Savings: ~$13.15M (97% of current cost)

Model-Driven Savings:

With XGBoost's 100% failure recall ‚Üí Could prevent nearly all $40k/failure costs

1% error rate still leaves $135,600 in preventable costs

3. Failure Pattern Insights
Top Failure Causes:

Heat Dissipation (33%)

Power Issues (28%)

Overstrain (23%)

Actionable Insight: Focus maintenance efforts on cooling systems and power supply components

4. Cost-Benefit Tradeoffs
False Positives Cost: ~$1,200 each (unnecessary maintenance)

False Negatives Cost: $40,000 each (missed failure)

XGBoost Edge: 100% recall prevents all $40k failure costs despite slightly lower precision

5. Operational Considerations
High ROI Potential:

Even 0.1% recall improvement = $54,240 savings

XGBoost's 1% better recall ‚Üí $542k annual savings

Preventive Maintenance Focus:

Target 84% of failures (Heat+Power+Overstrain) with specific checks

Potential 84% cost reduction ($11.4M) from targeted interventions

6. Model Deployment Strategy
Recommend XGBoost:

Marginally better performance (0.999 AUC)

100% failure recall critical for $40k/failure cost avoidance

Monitoring Needed:

Watch for model drift in sensor patterns

Regular recalibration recommended

7. Anomaly Detection
"No Failure" Flag:
2.65% of failures mislabeled ‚Üí Investigate data quality issues

Could indicate:

Sensor malfunctions

Human reporting errors

Unclassified failure modes

8. Practical Limitations
Overly Optimistic Scores:

0.999 AUC suggests possible data leakage/overfitting

Recommend validation on temporal split (newer machines)

Cost Assumption Sensitivity:

10% error in 40 k / failureestimate ‚Üí1.35M impact Regular cost model updates crucial
